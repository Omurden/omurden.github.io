    title: About Me
    summary: |
      QA Engineer at [Albert Heijn](https://www.ah.nl/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} based in Amsterdam — I love breaking things so others don't have to. I founded the [QAist Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/QAIstMeetup){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Robot Framework Turkey](https://www.meetup.com/Robot-Framework-Turkey){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} communities to bring testers together.

      When I'm not testing, I'm DJ-ing as [Dendenevet](https://www.instagram.com/dendenevent){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} — spinning 90's tracks and beyond. Follow upcoming events on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dendenevent/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dendenevent){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
